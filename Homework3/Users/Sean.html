        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Not much is known about the elusive Sean. In fact, the programmer of this website doesn't even
		know his last name, that's how elusive he is. What IS known about him is that he is a master in the
		gentle art of kayaking and programming. He is a suspected leader of the Illuminati and quite possibly
		anonymous as well. It has been conjectured that he isn't even mortal, but rather an entity that lives
		on the plane of existence inside of computers.</p>
        <p>Sean has totally hacked this website in order to inform everyone that his last name is 'Ulrich'
        and that he has no comment on being a part of either of the organizations listed above. He is a part
        of the aforementioned group whose site has lead to this web-page.</p>
